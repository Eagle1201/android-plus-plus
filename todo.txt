- GDB clients don't seem to detach under some circumstances (i.e. continuing through a signal handler until process death).

- Code to terminate active instances of GdbServer doesn't seem to be getting hit when attaching to a target.
  -- Is there a way to query a GDB server instance to check which process it's bound to?

- JDB isn't provided with a relevant -source path argument during boot.

- Use of regular expressions (RegEx.Match) in various places it showing pretty highly in the profiler.
  -- Can these be migrated to first-init compiled version of RegEx checking?
  -- Will that actually make any substancial difference?  

- Revise use of synchronisation 'lock' on various container types.
  -- Might be better migrating to a single (class shared) lock object.
  
- Would be nice if the GDB attach logic tried to push a relevant GdbServer executable to device if one can't be found.

- GDB/MI stepping instructions don't match what is expected behaviour in Visual Studio.
  - Might have to use temporary breakpoints to perform actions like line-code stepping without entering the stepped function.
