Version 0.3.2

New functionality:

 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of GDB 7.6 (32 and 64bit) from NDK r10b. Removed patched and original variants from r10.
 - (Debugger) Added initial support for GDB 7.6 asynchronous 'breakpoint-notifications'.
 - (Debugger) Added support for skipping of GDB/MI variable 'pseudo' children.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - Fixed an issue with bootstrapping where 'setx' environment variable registration is only accessible on new command prompts.
 - (Debugger) Bumped attach time-out to 60 seconds to support older, slower devices.
 - (Debugger) Improved protection against spaces in file-names in several additional places.
 - (Debugger) Improved performance and consistency of contiguous GDB/MI output, ensuring responses are handed in-order.
 - (Debugger) Fixed behaviour when GDB connections are lost or dropped. This should also include pulling the USB cable.
 - (Debugger) Added ability to process concurrent GDB/MI stream output whilst handling an 'async' event.
 - (MSBuild) Silenced the FC command which gave confusing stderr output when files weren't present.
 - (MSBuild) Modified 'AdditionalDependencies' to make its behaviour more consistent with Win32. Removed 'AdditionalLibraries' as a result.
 - (MSBuild) Added utilisation of response (argument) files for 'JavaCompile'-based compilation.

Version 0.3.1

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (Debugger) Switched to caching sysroot files and logging to the user's 'local' (rather than 'roaming') application data directory.
 - (Debugger) Fixed an issue exclusive to VS2013 where the 'ProjectDir' property wasn't available.

Version 0.3.0

New functionality:

 - Added a 'changes.txt'.
 - Added support for JDK 1.7 (tested with 1.7.0_67)
 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of GDB 7.3.1 and 7.6 (32 and 64bit).
 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of Python 2.7.5 (to support a requirement from GDB).
 - (Debugger) Added some magic GDB version workarounds to allow symbol retrieval on old (pre 4.2) and newer hardware.
 - (Debugger) Added a new connection pending UI dialog, and fixed majority of launch/connection stalls within Visual Studio.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (Debugger) Corrected problems when attempting to pull application libraries off a device, especially after Jelly Bean 4.2.
 - (Debugger) Major reworking of DebugLauncher components to support connection UI and asynchronous installations to device.
 - (Debugger) Ensured that the user is informed about devices that are affected by the run-as permissions bug.
 - (Debugger) Refactored retrieval of stack traces to prevent large stalls when switching threads.
 - (Debugger) Defaulted installer package to Google Play Marketplace (com.android.vending).
 - (Debugger) Fixed a device's SdkVersion property not being set correctly.
 - (Debugger) Fixed AndroidSetting.VersionCode using the wrong offset (should start from one, not zero).
 - (Debugger) Refactored handling and retrieval of device processes based on PID and Name.
 - (Debugger) Ensured failed installation attempts always delete the copied temporary file.
 - (Debugger) Added '/system/lib/libbinder.so' and '/system/lib/libutils.so' to default libraries pulled from device.
 - (Debugger) Added some early-rejection tests prior to most instances of regex testing.

Warnings:

 - Earlier (pre-1.7.0_67) versions of JDK 1.7 may experience problems connecting and debugging targets. Use JDK 1.6 or upgrade to resolve.
