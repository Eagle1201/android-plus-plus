Version 0.4.1

New functionality:
 - (MSBuild) Added customised class parsing to app-jar-dependencies, to avoid invocation of javap. Circa 30x speed improvement.
 - (MSBuild) Ensured error and warning output from javac is now displayed properly in the 'Error List' panel.
 - (Debugger) Changed default debugging device selection to prioritise attached devices before emulators.
 - (Debugger) Added an up-of-date check to ensure target applications aren't needlessly reinstalled when they haven't been modified.
 - (Debugger) Added automated control of 'debug.checkjni' and 'debug.egl.callstack' properties (configurable by debugger rules).
 - (Debugger) Added ability to disable GDB stopping on certain signal types; controllable via Debug -> Exceptions.
 - (Debugger) Added support for GDB 'common.setup' script for controlling ART debugging in r10c onwards.
 - (Debugger) Now using 'ps -t' results to seed nice thread display names for System/VM processes.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (MSBuild) Fixed a number of issues causing dependencies to not be evaluated properly between library projects and Applications.
 - (MSBuild) Ensured compression strength when adding resources to unsigned APKs is set to maximum.
 - (Debugger) Fixed a number of issues causing debugging of 32-bit builds on 64-bit devices to fail.
 - (MSBuild) Upgraded and reorganised SDL2 sample projects.

Version 0.4.0

New functionality:

 - Added support for Android L Preview and Android Lollipop.
 - Added a custom-built version of 'zipalign' to support APK archives above 2GB.
 - Added a custom-built version of 'ndk-depends' to manually supply up-to-date listings of internal device libraries.
 - (MSBuild) Added support for NDK r10c and 64-bit targets. Currently only 'arm64-v8a' supported.
 - (MSBuild) Added support for armeabi-v7a-hard (hard-float).
 - (MSBuild) Added support for whole program optimisations via ProGuard integration.
 - (MSBuild) Added support for automated exporting of multi-dex compatible Dalvik executables. (https://developer.android.com/tools/building/multidex.html)
 - (MSBuild) Added toolchain configurations for GCC 4.9, Clang 3.4, and Clang 3.5.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (MSBuild) Improved identification of exported scripts; version descriptors are now copied alongside each platform.
 - (MSBuild) Fixed an issue causing Java compilation to occur only on BuildConfig.java and R.java files, despite lack of project .java sources.

Upgrade notes:

 - An r10 derivative release of the Android NDK is required in order to target 64-bit architectures.
 - (MSBuild) ProGuard configuration scripts (named 'proguard.txt' or 'proguard-project.txt') can now be placed alongside a AndroidManifest.xml

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.2

New functionality:

 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of GDB 7.6 (32 and 64bit) from NDK r10b. Removed patched and original variants from r10.
 - (Debugger) Added initial support for GDB 7.6 asynchronous 'breakpoint-notifications'.
 - (Debugger) Added support for skipping of GDB/MI variable 'pseudo' children.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - Fixed an issue with bootstrapping where 'setx' environment variable registration is only accessible on new command prompts.
 - (Debugger) Bumped attach time-out to 60 seconds to support older, slower devices.
 - (Debugger) Improved protection against spaces in file-names in several additional places.
 - (Debugger) Improved performance and consistency of contiguous GDB/MI output, ensuring responses are handed in-order.
 - (Debugger) Fixed behaviour when GDB connections are lost or dropped. This should also include pulling the USB cable.
 - (Debugger) Added ability to process concurrent GDB/MI stream output whilst handling an 'async' event.
 - (MSBuild) Silenced the FC command which gave confusing stderr output when files weren't present.
 - (MSBuild) Modified 'AdditionalDependencies' to make its behaviour more consistent with Win32. Removed 'AdditionalLibraries' as a result.
 - (MSBuild) Added utilisation of response (argument) files for 'JavaCompile'-based compilation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.1

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (Debugger) Switched to caching sysroot files and logging to the user's 'local' (rather than 'roaming') application data directory.
 - (Debugger) Fixed an issue exclusive to VS2013 where the 'ProjectDir' property wasn't available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.0

New functionality:

 - Added a 'changes.txt'.
 - Added support for JDK 1.7 (tested with 1.7.0_67)
 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of GDB 7.3.1 and 7.6 (32 and 64bit).
 - (Debugger) Added redistributions of Python 2.7.5 (to support a requirement from GDB).
 - (Debugger) Added some magic GDB version workarounds to allow symbol retrieval on old (pre 4.2) and newer hardware.
 - (Debugger) Added a new connection pending UI dialog, and fixed majority of launch/connection stalls within Visual Studio.

Fixes/Improvements:

 - (Debugger) Corrected problems when attempting to pull application libraries off a device, especially after Jelly Bean 4.2.
 - (Debugger) Major reworking of DebugLauncher components to support connection UI and asynchronous installations to device.
 - (Debugger) Ensured that the user is informed about devices that are affected by the run-as permissions bug.
 - (Debugger) Refactored retrieval of stack traces to prevent large stalls when switching threads.
 - (Debugger) Defaulted installer package to Google Play Marketplace (com.android.vending).
 - (Debugger) Fixed a device's SdkVersion property not being set correctly.
 - (Debugger) Fixed AndroidSetting.VersionCode using the wrong offset (should start from one, not zero).
 - (Debugger) Refactored handling and retrieval of device processes based on PID and Name.
 - (Debugger) Ensured failed installation attempts always delete the copied temporary file.
 - (Debugger) Added '/system/lib/libbinder.so' and '/system/lib/libutils.so' to default libraries pulled from device.
 - (Debugger) Added some early-rejection tests prior to most instances of regex testing.

Warnings:

 - Earlier (pre-1.7.0_67) versions of JDK 1.7 may experience problems connecting and debugging targets. Use JDK 1.6 or upgrade to resolve.
